about=<p>Processing provider for SAGA 9.2 and above. Requires manual installation of SAGA binaries.</p>
    <p>Since QGIS 3.30 SAGA tools are no included in the standard QGIS installation. In order to use SAGA
    tools in QGIS you need to install this plugin first, and then manually install SAGA 9.2.0 (or later).</p>
    <p>To install SAGA visit: <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/saga-gis/files/SAGA%20-%209/">https://sourceforge.net/projects/saga-gis/files/SAGA%20-%209/</a>.
    This plugin is tested on SAGA 9.2 only. It may work for more recent releases.</p>
    <p>After downloading SAGA, unzip the folder. Then in QGIS go to
    Settings -> Options -> Processing -> Providers -> SAGANG and point the SAGA folder to your unzipped folder
    containing the SAGA binaries.</p>
